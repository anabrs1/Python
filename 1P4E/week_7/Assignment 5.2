# FIND SMALLEST AND LARGEST NUMBER FROM THE USER INPUT#
#5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. 
# Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
# If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. 
# Enter the numbers from the book for problem 5.1 and Match the desired output as shown. 

#define variables
largest = None
smallest = None 

#loop to test that aks the user to enter a number and if he/she enter the word done it stops#
while True:
     num = raw_input("Enter a integer number: ")
     if num == "done" : break # break the loop when the workd done is written in the user input
     if len(num)< 1: break # check empty line
     try: 
          num = int(num) #convert the user input (string) to integer
     except:
          print "Invalid input" # if the use gives another input that is not integer it will prompt a message of invalid input
          continue  # if the value is invalue goes to top and start the iteration again
#find min num:
     if smallest is None or num < smallest:
          smallest = num
#find larg num:
     if largest is None or num > largest:
          largest = num

print "Maximum is", largest
print "Minimum is", smallest
