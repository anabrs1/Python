#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. 
# Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use raw_input to read a
# string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
# Enter the number of working hours#
hrs = raw_input ("Enter hours:")
rate = raw_input ("Enter rate:")
# Convert hrs and rate to float because the raw_input always read string#
pay = float(hrs)*float(rate)
print pay
