# Assignment: Following Links in HTML Using BeautifulSoup

# In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular 
#position from the top and follow that link, repeat the process a number of times, and report the last name you find.

# Note - this code must run in Python 2.x and you must download
# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/BeautifulSoup.py
# Into the same folder as this program
#  In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/urllinks.py.
#The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below,
# extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative
# to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.
# We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment
#
#     Sample problem: Start at http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
#     Find the link at position 3 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 4 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
#     Sequence of names: Fikret Montgomery Mhairade Butchi Anayah
#     Last name in sequence: Anayah
#     Actual problem: Start at: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Shane.html
#     Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
#     Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: D

    url = tags[position-1].get('href', None)# get the href taht has this tag
print url
