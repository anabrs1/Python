#In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. 
#You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.
#Handling The Data

#The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, 
#look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of
# '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and summing up the integers.

handle = open(name)
#print handle
stuff =list()
numbers = 0

for line in handle:
	line = line.rstrip()
	stuff = re.findall ('[0-9]+', line)
	inp = list(stuff)
	if stuff == []: continue
	for line in stuff:
		numbers = numbers + int(line)
