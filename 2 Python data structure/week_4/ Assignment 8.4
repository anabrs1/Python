#8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, 
#split the line into a list of words using the split() method. 
#The program should build a list of words. For each word on each 
#line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append 
#it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
