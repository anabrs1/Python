This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of my free textbook titled, 'Programming for Informatics: Exploring Information' 
(www.pythonlearn.com). This course is equivalent to the second half of the 11-week 'Programming for Everybody (Python)' 
course.We have put a lot of detail about the course into the document titled 'Syllabus' which can be found in Week 1, so 
please take a moment to review it. 
Week 2 is about optionally installing Python so you can develop and run the programs needed to complete this course. 

Structure:
Chapter seven: files
Chapter eight: lists
Chapter nine: dictionaries
Chapter ten: tuples
