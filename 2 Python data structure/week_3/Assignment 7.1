# 7.1 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
#and print the contents of the file in upper case. Use the file words.txt to produce the output below.

#You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/words.txt
#You should use strip() or rstrip() to avoid double newlines.  You may need to scroll down to see a mis-match of the output.

#Write a program that prompts for a file name
#suffix = "MIND-NUMBING"
#text = raw_input("Enter name of the file: ")
#if text == "words":
     #text = open("words.txt")#open the file  
     #text = text.read() #read the file
     #text = text.upper()#change to capital letters
     #for line in text:
          #line =line.rstrip()
          #if line.endswith (suffix):
               #print text
#print text


#option given in the exercise
count = 0
text = raw_input('Enter file name: ')# words.txt
if len(text)==0:
     text = 'words.txt'#this line allow us to avoid entering the name using the enter to do it
print text
fn = open(text)
for line in fn: 
     line = line.rstrip().upper() #delete white spaces and change to uppercase
     print line
