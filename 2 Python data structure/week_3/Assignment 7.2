 #7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
#+Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce
# an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
#+You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.

count =0
total =0
text = raw_input('Enter file name: ')# mbox-short.txt
if len(text)==0:
     text = 'mbox-short.txt'#this line allow to access the file usign the enter i.e. 0 length of the input user
fn = open(text)#open the file
for line in fn: 
     if not line.startswith('X-DSPAM-Confidence:'): # it will search for the word IF NOT coutinue
          continue
     where = line.find(':') # when it finds the word then it will identify where is the number     
     num = line[where+1:] #slice to extract the part that corresponds to the find       
     number = float(num) 
     #print number 
     #inputs for to estimate the average
     count = count +1
     print float(count)
     total = total + number
     print total
     print num, total, count 
print "Average spam confidence: ", total / count
